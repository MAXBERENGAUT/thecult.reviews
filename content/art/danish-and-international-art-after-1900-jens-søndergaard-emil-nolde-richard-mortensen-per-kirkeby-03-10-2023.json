  "body": "Dennmark and the rest of Scandinavia, with the exception of one painting by Edvard Munch, have more or less been forgotten about when it comes to the standard American conception of Modern Art. This exhibit, only accessible through bridges that extend from the old part of the museum to a new fancy cloaked in white avenue for art, has tall windows which pair nicely to the art on display, especially if it's snowing like crazy outside. I loved this exhibit. I discovered so many artists I'd never heard of before but whose artistry spoke for itself and more. Jens Søndergaard, Emil Nolde, Richard Mortensen, Per Kirkeby, Victor Vasarely, etc. If you are an art lover and you find yourself in Copenhagen you have to see this exhibit. The darkness of the climate has produced some truly psychologically devastating art.",
