  "body": "The Revenant is a movie that is about a man who gets lost in the frontier and has to fend for himself. This man is Leonardo DiCaprio. He has to fight off and kill a bear, he has to find the man who left him for dead and murdered his son, he has to escape from Frenchmen and fearsome Indians, he has to shoot himself in the jaw to put it back together. None of this makes a character though, so it's interesting thinking about what it is about this movie that makes it work if so much of it is not really strong character development. I think it's the attention to detail in the cinematic craft, in the natural light camerawork which extends the beauty of the set design and the natural location into the movie itself, and of course, into the acting. DiCaprio won an Oscar for this role, but it's the entire cast that works, especially Tom Hardy, while Domnhall Gleeson and Will Poulter do a great job as well. DiCaprio never feels like he isn't DiCaprio, but at the same time, he made me feel like I was watching a random man deal with some of the worst set of circumstances I've ever heard of. The movie is a well-made big budget mainstream movie. A rare affair. It isn't perfect. Without subtitles I probably wouldn't be able to understand the dialogue. The way the frontier is treated is a little rudimentary in terms of its social analysis. The character work is virtually non-existent. But it is a gripping and often beautiful film.",
