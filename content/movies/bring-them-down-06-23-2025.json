  "body": "A host of passionate secrecy the movie breaks into, it separates the political and the physical and then almost absentmindedly but competently reconnects it. The acting comprises fear and not much else but then that's how movies can reinterpret reality, even with splotches of amateurism, they can formulate visceral adult entertainment on a scale fit for more than it reached. Storytelling is a lost art. It will probably die forever in those old ecclesiastical annals of esotericism. The world has moved on, it's about cheap emotion now, it's about stupid youtube videos that fake insight for the cherubic hopeless masses and a warning it comprises for those still lost in their purposefulness. There's no room anymore for wandering purpose. There isn't any light. There is only the television. There is only anemia. People moving on. Cult status likely, this movie will be famous in time. It will be in a youtube clip, and people will watch it. They will be blind, the people will be blind. There won't be any more secrets in flesh exchanging -- heart swaps, it will die.",
