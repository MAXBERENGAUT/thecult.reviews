  "body": "mostly writing this down so I remember it. Never is or has a score been so pointless. The movie is dumb, cringy at times, very 70s and not in a good way. But it did make me feel something. I was creeped out by the water on the staircase (the water is white people) and there were scenes with tension to them. A bit too academic for me but that did bring with it some nice moments with repetition and scarcity of thought -- density -- and I liked! the cinematography. Like the scene where he's following Chris is very nice and the Eisenhowerian family scene design is nice so it's too bad about the acting and dialogue. An interesting movie about a mental breakdown or a sort of psychotic break.",
