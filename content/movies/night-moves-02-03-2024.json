  "body": "Night Moves is a movie that has far reaching emotional aspects, and I say that because it’s been months since I’ve seen it and I am still thinking about its images: Florida. The boat with the see-through floor, the teenage girl naked in the water, the house and its hacienda porches and off-color stainings. Gene Hackman as a cuckold, by a paraplegic no less. All of the trappings and none of the problems that contemporary cultural filler present, the sex and the moral ambiguity of something now without any of the dumbing down, the only real issue is how old-fashioned the cinematography is but that just emphasizes the decade (the 70s) more than anything else. It’s somewhat like a cross of McCabe and the Long Goodbye. The apathy is the point: I don’t care about you and I never will.",
