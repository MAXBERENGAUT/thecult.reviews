  "body": "An adaptation of a John le Carre novel, ‘The Spy Who Came in from the Cold’, is a smart and convincing Cold War anti-spy film. There is wonderful cinematography, particularly in the interrogation scenes between Leamus and Fielder. The film is carried by an exceptionally powerful performance from Richard Burton as Leamus, who brilliantly underplays the character. For a lead character who is never in control, even when he thinks he is, he retains dignity and respect.\n\nThe one issue I had with the movie was the girl, Nan Perry, who is rather badly acted and is completely underdeveloped as a character. If she was more of a person and wasn’t unrealistically immediately devoted to Leamus upon seeing him and despite his maltreatment of her, the twist in the courtroom scene would have had more of an effect. Nonetheless, the wonderful last close-up shot of Leamus before he returns to the German side of the wall magnificently summarizes the emotional and intellectual complexities of the film, where it is never clear which side of the wall holds the villains and which side holds the heroes.",
