  "body": "I hate words, they're really just excuses. Images are different, love is different. Passion is different. We live for quiet moments no matter how loud. Death, what a construct. Fantasies, daydreams, how convenient for disappointment. To try to be nice, such a shame. Every artsy, kino bastard should throw up and lose if they don't see Rohmer already completed that skill tree. It's done! No more! And it's narrative skill that makes it good, not this film school bullshit which is really just a grown-up version of connect-the-dots on kids menus from tex mexes. Your weak-ass creative method is fake. This, Rohmer, this is real. Without truth art is worthless. Without trying life is pointless. I need to try so fucking hard, so much fucking more, I need to, I have no other choice, this pain is too much.",
