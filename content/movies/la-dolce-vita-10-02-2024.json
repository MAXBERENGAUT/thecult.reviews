  "body": "There's a lot of the world in this movie. It's cool. Narratively complex, cinematically dense, toned perfectly. It's not really what I like about movies. That stuff is what separates but it's not what connects for me. I like dialogue that makes feel different. Cinema that takes me somewhere else, outside of this. It's never outside itself. Never outside of the world. It reminds me of the Cuaron netlix movie Roma. Like yeah that's a great movie, but it's not what I like about movies. It's a good but somewhat unstimulating book. I think I like Hitchcock more than this. Hitchcock is like a pamphlet, this is like a stack of papers with no staple. People who say they prefer the stack of papers are cool, like I like them, I wish the best for them, I wish all my enemies the best really. Marcello Mastroianni is really good, and it's a great script. Isn't that tone tiring though? Like I think I want people to be like me, no one in this movie is like me. Yeah that's my problem. Still locked in my head but out of it for this movie, well, locked in a different more analytical less silly part of my brain. Human condition --- that's what this movie isn't about. Same with Roma. Still really really cool movies though. Like a formula 1 rally.",
