  "body": "My problem with the second Knives Out is that they took all the funny parts out of the first one and then just repeated them over again. The mystery here, or at least the solution, is taken from an episode of Columbo. This means that what is left, as for suspense and tension, is its admittedly sophisticated plot mechanics. The humor is almost completely spoilt, so any fun the movie has is in its somewhat contrived alliance between Daniel Craig and in this one Janelle Monae. Like it did with Ana de Armas, this alliance flat out narratively works well. Where the movies gets tiring, or at least where it did for me, is the horrible set design. This is not on the set decorators; they were likely told to make a really ugly house to fit the story. However, that does not change the fact of it being ugly. In fact, it makes it worse, because they are deliberately choosing to make it ugly, all in order to fit the Columbo (S1E2) detective plot. Also why was Ethan Hawke in this movie?",
