  "body": "I watched it with my friend and we laughed at certain parts of it. The basic plot of this movie is ridiculous, and it shouldn’t really work, at least not really, but I liked its self-insistence and its desire to shock. Anya Taylor-Joy shows why she is a perfect lead actress, funny and beautiful while always retaining moral strength, and she adopts the affectations of her harlot character in a way which makes you love her more for it. Nicholas Hoult and a cast of talented character actors provide the comedic entertainment, while Ralph Fiennes as the movie’s self-imposed villain does well with what is objectively somewhat ham-fisted material. I was also interested by the movie’s setting. The outer banks? The food critic character also talks in a similar way to one of my professors, which I liked.",
