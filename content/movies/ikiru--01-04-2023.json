  "body": "Akira Kurosawa exemplifies the cinema attitude of the seminal YouTube channel 'Every Frame A Painting', because he takes the opportunity of filmmaking to present every shot as its own little piece of beauty. There are throw away shots here that have multiple layers of purposeful blocking, instead of using the rule of thirds he uses a rule of fifths, mirrors are used in the way early 20th - or late 19th - century French painters used, and the plotting has a humanistic pulse to it which speaks to Kurosawa's fondness for the laureates of Russian literature. Combined together these auter affectations create a unique and original work of cinematic art, a piece that has both a beating heart and artistic ambition. Ikiru follows Mr. Watanabe, a man who has let his life become stifled by bureaucracy, after he finds out he has terminal stomach cancer. Slowly he comes to realize the path forward he must take in his remaining time on earth. Takashi Shimura in his performance utilizes something strange, a near psychosis, a bugging out of his eyes, which sometimes feels overdone, but, at other times, feels really real. Every black and white Kurosawa film reconsiders the concept of color in every frame. The close-ups in this movie, especially those of Mr. Watanabe's young friend, played by Miki Odagiri, reveal so much about human nature, or at least it feels like it, the end goal of art. The 1 point is taken off for its slow pace during its first half.",
