  "body": "Movies, perhaps more so than books, much more so than music, are subject to a somewhat unfair but meaningful discourse on the morality of its presentation. That has meant censorship. There's a side to this discourse that particularly interests me: antiheroes: charismatic, compulsively watchable, evil, admirable, memorable: Jordan Belfort, Hans Landa, Ethan Edwards: the trifecta of art mixed with ironic, unfortunately non-universal messaging that *intuitively* glorifies ideals and ideas that the filmmakers (maybe not actors) seek to send up, to satirize, to critique, but end up producing the opposite: the affluence and staying power of the antihero and their coolness: retaining none of the irony and perhaps making the film itself a net negative. For me, that much is obvious, but less clear cut is how culpable the filmmakers are, because Ford and Tarantino and Scorsese truly admired their antiheroes despite their distaste, and the films suffer as a result. However, in the case of the Searchers, the cinematography, direction, narrative technique, brutal sense of truth, make for a great, ambitious movie. Today they wouldn't allow such one-sided depictions of Indians, despite the irony, and unfortunately despite its flaws (of which there are many) the version they'd make today would be worse because the contemporary system is incapable of registering the above and contextualizing it into substantive practice, they just drag their tails around in a hopeless lie of purpose and ambition, leaving any possible of a lifetime spent with art to the ground of their core denial of any responsibility to intellectual perusal.",
