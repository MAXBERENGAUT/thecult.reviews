  "body": "In a very basic way, it's one of my favorite movies ever. The cinematography is kind of awful, it's washed out and colors bleed strangely. It's almost very clearly done poorly. But the writing is good enough that suddenly at the end if the snow the whole experience becomes beautiful. The remove that the 'eye' operates from becomes the perfect distance to understand the sense of Life depicted. Man dies to useless, dumb bravery, Woman dies to overstimulation and chemical senselessness. The Company is rational. It's modernity. The world follows a standard narrative line of casual cause and effect. And there's a wonderful sensual beauty to how McCabe sees her take another customer the first times it's depicted. It's deeply painful. And Leonard Cohen, and the frontier pacific northwest western. The empty church, an anti-monopoly story cynical on the antitrust law's effect. I love Julie Christie, and I like how Warren Beatty carries so much physicality into a performance of an unbelievably weak man. This tone and story and setting are one of a kind in world cinema. It's hard to capture this kind of subtle, happy cynicism and still make it more or less interesting on a classic storytelling level. On second watching, my wonder and awe is diminished somewhat but my deference isn't.",
