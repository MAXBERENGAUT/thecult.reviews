  "body": "When you conceptualize of a heist movie, you run an imaginary gauntlet: purpose (Robin Hood); star power; humor; intellectualism; stakes; bad odds; the plan; the team and its construction; the plan's execution and the awry moments; and a woman in there. The weird thing about Ocean's Eleven is that all of those facets are somehow not made to be actually impactful or meaningful but it's never at any moment openly (or veiledly) satirical. It's mostly just entertaining, it's mostly just a movie. We or I remembered Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Bernie Mac, Elliot Gould, and Matt Damon and a sense of goodness but this time I actually noticed Julia Roberts and then Andy Garcia in a new light. Like all good villains, Garcia plays the role as if he sincerely believes his character is in the right. Which he is. The interplay between Pitt and Clooney is funny because it takes the form of an actual character which neither of them are. None of the actors really seem to care that much that they're in a movie or this particular one, it's almost slice-of-life in that respect. I'm not sure if it's Art. There's a hazy inestimable line between E. and A., not in a high-minded or low-down way, but in an almost meaningful in its futility serious and yet brief way, like a parting word dipped in anxiety.",
