  "body": "Had a standard day. Asked a big boob cheerleader for her number. Got a promotion. Finished a good movie. Sensual ass movie. \"Evocative,\" as people like my mom say. Also wrote three poems and some zany prose. Sober, one day at a time. Poor dude, the 'old' guy in this movie. 19!? That guy looks 45 years old. Weird how little this movie has to say given how much it postures. Well directed.",
