  "body": "Jules Dassin has a cool rap sheet: movies on movies on films on movies. Brute Force is about a doomed prison break and the relationship between a construct like a prison and its inmates. When the movie explores those themes purely, it is exceptional. Its crowd shots are extraordinary. I've only spent one night in prison (jail) but that pyschoactive suffering is a lot more than what's explored sometimes rotely here. I don't mind though. We all got mouths to feed. Burt Lancaster and Hume Cronyn are really good. The directing's great. It's weird; if the movie had done its routine more simply or sophisticatedly, its larger societal analysis would be more effective. The doctor character, for example, why is he so boring? It prompts critics (film ones) to pontificate and star-gaze instead of looking inward. That self-gaze is only possible on my website when it comes to this movieâ€”in my opinion. Reading recent Ondaatje, I hope this is not the norm for him it's so boring, so much meaningless.",
