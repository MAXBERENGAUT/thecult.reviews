  "body": "organizing my books, prolly going to read some short story collections & shit, I guess maybe some novels, I'm going to read—I've never jammed in a band—never even exceeded novice level on any instrument—have no musical ability, past literary brain and emotional conaissance; and that's not a talent really discernible or moderately accessible; strenuous memory i.e.; not tangible—fungible—so time's a factor. Radiohead are obviously pretty cool but let's drop it with the Coldplay references. They will never be as culturally important. Future listens to one and not the other for a reason. Haha. Crazy cool setlist: best of their best three albums, some great rocks songs, fun performance, breezing through the show practices like love on a Tuesday night (or any night)—I see why people fuck, like shit, I do want to, but fish fry and such, women are always going to be there, I'm in no need of a body, just romantic companionship and sexual worship. Concerts are boring and performative because they exclude intellectual self-analysis, they make it irrelevant.",
