  "body": "Along the Great Divide is a western B-movie from the early 1950s starring Kurt Russel (who’s Jewish surprisingly) as a U.S. Marshall who brings a man accused of murder across a desert as the murderee’s father tries to lynch the accused murderer. Then the accused murderer’s daughter turns up, in a strange old-fashioned way where they realize they need a love interest, and then insert the love interest, and then somehow, strangely, it’s actually kind of good - as far as love interests go. It’s like we have all of these pieces, let's just interact with them. There’s a really interesting scene near the end, because even though it’s a western B-movie it’s kind of a dark concept for a scene, like literally I don’t think movies nowadays are anywhere near as dark as that scene. Like it’s fucked up. In a PG B-movie way, yeah, but still, that’s pretty fucked up. The two romantic leads have a lot of chemistry. The dialogue is pretty good. The staging is nice. Direction and editing are hit or miss throughout, and really, it’s too low budget. I was thinking about remaking it or adapting it. But I don’t know if it swings.",
