  "body": "I have cried for the first time in a bit. My life is so sucky. I am completely unable to manage and balance human relationships effectively. I can't do it. I just can't. I'd kill myself but my parents are still here and I don't want to break their hearts. Stranger Than Paradise is a great movie. It made me forget about all of this as I just watched and observed. After the movie ended, I wasn't anywhere different, but I did feel as if the small part of my brain that connects to art had been consistently satisfied. The cinematography of 'Stranger Than Paradise' is black-and-white and beautiful, its writing is fascinating, and its acting is great. Its small budget, its independent aura, everything about it works at a high level. All of the shots are on location and it shows. Each room, there are three which are important, is given an almost perfect visual analysis that combs together every possible unique angle. Each shot is slightly adjusted to look more interesting than it otherwise would have been. There are no repeated shots. The blocking is frankly perfect.",
