  "body": "This is going to seem like a bad review, but it’s not really. ‘The Sting’ is a paint-by-numbers ‘heist’ movie that may have had a lasting pop culture influence but does not really hold up to its name today. There are maybe 2 great scenes: the card game and the final heist. Paul Newman does a great job. Robert Redford is eye candy for fans who like male eye candy (i.e., Tobias Fünke) but to me he was sort of dull. This movie feels like a movie with training wheels on. Almost every twist and turn is set up in a painfully obvious way which leaves literally no room for interpretation. The movie makes sure you don’t miss anything. The humor exists but it does not work with the slow-plodding pace of the film. That being said, the movie works. At the end, I was excited. I didn’t really like it but I was.",
