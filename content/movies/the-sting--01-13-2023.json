  "body": "This is going to seem like a bad review, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not really. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Sting\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is a paint-by-numbers \u00e2\u0080\u0098heist\u00e2\u0080\u0099 movie that may have had a lasting pop culture influence but does not really hold up to its name today. There are maybe 2 great scenes: the card game and the final heist. Paul Newman does a great job. Robert Redford is eye candy for fans who like male eye candy (i.e., Tobias F\u00c3\u00bcnke) but to me he was sort of dull. This movie feels like a movie with training wheels on. Almost every twist and turn is set up in a painfully obvious way which leaves literally no room for interpretation. The movie makes sure you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss anything. The humor exists but it does not work with the slow-plodding pace of the film. That being said, the movie works. At the end, I was excited. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really like it but I was.",
