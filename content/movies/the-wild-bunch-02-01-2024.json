  "body": "Since I've been around it's been pretty difficult, to say the least, to get what I want. Some people can get it and I want to be like them in that way but not in any other way which just isn't how the world works. All my life I've learned it's better to keep my mouth shut and my eyes to the wall. Women are not men, but to what specific degree they're different and to what that means please don't ask me. I don't know. It's like a high thought with friends: what if there was a third sex? Soon my thoughts and ideas will be corroborated into dust and the few people who have known me or helped me will turn away from my true self and think only for themselves. Nobody is honestly selfless. Dishonest people have no reason to avoid emotions like me. But they do anyways. The violence and perspective on ethnic differences—read: civilizational differences—is excessive but in the scattered Kurosawa/Leone plot lines there is real detail and craftsmanship. The direction is prolific, perhaps never fully stylistically realized but still wonderfully painstaking in its storyboarding. I like the characters and actors in this movie, some of the things they do are sad but at the end of the day they're human, no matter how grotesque or exaggerated. They wouldn't turn around to ashamedly apologize to populist props. They'd stay true to themselves, even if they're fictional.",
