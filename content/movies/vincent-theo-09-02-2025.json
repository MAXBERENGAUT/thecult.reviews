  "body": "As far as movies go Robert Altman's are really well shot and beautiful. There's some shots here that are pretty rare artistically speaking, in that I can count on ten fingers the amount of directors capable of the beauty of it. And it's not like stereotypical beauty, it's a short stone staircase in a front garden, and the shot is at an angle, and it's beautiful. There's space to the side yard behind, a different color, browner and somewhat lighter. The house itself is plain in its elegance. The staircase is normal. And yet it's beautiful. I learned some stuff about Van Gogh and also that time of French impressionism. I wasn't altogether too impressed with its psychological insight, and the narrative style was maybe not the best fit for the story. It was emotional at times, Van Gogh's focus, and overall I enjoyed it. But if I wasn't in a movie theater I might have turned it off or looked at my phone. Faces are also shot really well.",
