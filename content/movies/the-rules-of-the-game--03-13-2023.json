  "body": "Somewhere along the way I started to think of narrative storytelling as the vast summation of sequences inside the bare bones of the first shot/word and the last shot/word. This has little to do with my formal education. I've learned that it's rare for a work of narrative art to actively unspool creative sequence after creative sequence. In this sense a 'creative sequence' is the use of a story's setting, characters, and conflict within a spontaneous moment. 'The Rules of the Game' has two great sequences, and many great scenes (the miniature version of a sequence). All of them are perfectly contained and efficiently executed. It is a social satire of French higher society that pokes fun at them but also loves them and the little dramas of their private life. Above all else the characters respect the social status quo. The first great sequence is a hunting party and the second is a long gestating brawl. The cinematography is relaxed and unobtrusive yet still stylish. Lost for some time after its first release, 'The Rules of the Game' has a well-deserved reputation today as a great art-house film.",
