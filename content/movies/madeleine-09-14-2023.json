  "body": "There's a trick to filmmaking: a pretty woman. Ann Todd as 'Madeleine' really goes for it in this movie. She is maybe a little old but it isn't a bad thing. It makes her beauty so much the more involving. The best parts of the cinematic experience to me are when you care about what happens next. This movie is really good at this. I care about her bedroom in the basement. There are these bars on her window up to the sidewalk, and notes that fall down into the cracks and canes which tap against windows. I care about her. The ending actually makes the strangely confusing nature of the story have a surprising narrative weight. She looks into the camera and smiles. There's an earlier moment when one of the lawyers looks into the camera and implores the jury to make the right decision. This invocation, because, there is no better word, translates Madeleine's peril into a metaphor for what happens in our brains as we weigh up an important choice. A precipice of bitter action is like a tonic. Look at how all the bottles in the drug shops line up in rows like the crowd in the courtroom. There is an uncommon sensibility in how David Lean sees rooms. The way she moves and the way the camera follows her is a magic balancing act. He reportedly made it for her as a wedding present and got grouchy about it so has since derided it but I feel like if he was alive today he would have reappraised it somewhat. So many great directors are dead. You know, sometimes, when I walk past someone in the street I wobble a little bit after they pass. Then I smile to myself.",
