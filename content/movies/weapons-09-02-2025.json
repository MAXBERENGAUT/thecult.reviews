  "body": "Maybe part of the reason I'm growing out of publishing reviews on this website is that I don't see the utility any more. I've crowded out through sheer volume the sense of personal utility -- I tend to do this with many things, I overuse and then compulsively denigrate, or use at all, sadly. Over the span of two days I kind of reached an internal boiling point with important interpersonal relationships in my life. I saw Weapons and I felt tired. I'm tired of reading social discussion into my antipathy towards social concepts of art. So what if this movie is boring. Why can't I connect with people over it, why do I have to find a hiding place where no one can find me. This movie is fine. The villain lady is pretty funny, there's a lot of moments that made me laugh in a hazardous way --- but not the villain's death which had everyone laughing -- then i was looking stonily at the screen angry at the world for creating people who laughed at things I didn't find THAT funny. Like why weren't you laughing when the pot bonked off his face? Or the way the villain went, oh you're soo eeny weeny to the kid. And that becomes my intellectual umbrage. That's useless. But I return to it, or rather, I'm compulsively adhered to it. One day I'm hopeful i'll no longer be sad about girls :(",
