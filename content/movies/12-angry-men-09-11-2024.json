  "body": "I believe in anarchy it makes more sense than this it's a lot less fair but it actually scratches that itch instead of releasing the heart-worm of unbegotten sympathy which doesn't analyze â€” there is no analysis when people are thrown into a ring and made to lurch their way out just look at what Sotomayor said this isn't justice it's fascinating mob violence all to protect a man who was only aptly cast once in his life or at least his ego and of my favorite things about this movie is how the different jurrors change their mind and in what order because that's how the world falls or rebuilds depending on what or who you believe like so much there is no opacity to the cinematography or blocking it's flat out indecipherable except for the close-ups and yeah it is a good movie just if a movie this smart ever happens again I will take the cynical, contrarion angle no matter what because that's how the world works when you're rich",
