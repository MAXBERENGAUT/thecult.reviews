  "body": "Matt Damon's character is never shown doing any work. The intellectualism is just treated an equals sign between time and books. I don't know if it's a good movie about genius. Like I don't think genius is every this sexy. I get it's a movie but people sane and not take their lessons in life from movies, they study and compare. I think Damon would've been fucked if he wasn't friends with Affleck, I think he still knows that. It's the touch that really makes this movie Hollywood, like don't get me wrong, it's well-written, but it's not like smart people just know things, they don't, they guess and hope and feel at the bottom of their hole there is another passageway. I hate how much I believed so half-mindedly in this movie. Like, Winslow Homer knock off? Ok, ok, you don't know either do you what's on the other side of that blank wall do you. I thought you did. Why would you make a movie about it unless you did. Because you could? Ok, ok. I don't mind. It's still a good American movie with a really well done soundtrack and sense for the moment. Typical. Haha. I want to stop searching, internally, for that other side.",
