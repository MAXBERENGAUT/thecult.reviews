  "body": "Certain directors prioritize doing something new over doing something perfect, and it works. Stylistically Michael Haneke has never had any issues standing out from the rest of the pack, but when he takes narrative risks the consequent output is unique and exciting. The main narrative risk for 'The Piano Teacher' is its love for the central character, Erika, the respected piano teacher, masterfully played by Isabelle Huppert, who slowly is losing grip with reality. This is because Erika doesn't treat people how she should, she sees how her fascinatingly close but still emotionally repulsive relationship with her mother (Annie Girardot) has strangled her life, but she doesn't act any different with her heavily-pressured students who are clearly just as internally upset as her. She also has uncommon sexual urges which are depicted in a strange manner, at times it feels like a perverse analysis of a quietly withering soul, though you never get the sense that the movie dislikes her. She clearly has severe mental health issues, but the beauty of the movie is that its capsule, a clean-cut sophisticated sexual drama, doesn't pick and choose when to reintroduce the psychological undertones, it's somehow always there, in the small details of every single thing she does. Benoít Magimel is great across from Isabelle Huppert, and from the beginning he shows the edges of what she should be wary of, a complete and utter lack of fear. It's true, the insight into human psychology is not necessarily new for cinematic art, seeing as how Bergman was around and everything, but Haneke feels a lot closer to this than Bergman feels to the sisters in 'Cries and Whispers'.",
