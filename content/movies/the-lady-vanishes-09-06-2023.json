  "body": "I've been writing about Hitchcock a lot lately. At times I think I'm kinda weird. This movie appeals to this animal part of me that I have no control over. Love is its main focus. Its clothes the dark. Intrigue, suspense, and color its heart. Michael Redgrave and Vanessa Lockwood have nice chemistry. I want someone in that way. Do you understand me? See the detail in the hotelman and the ingenuity in its train corridors? I have trouble understanding myself sometimes but often it's because I live in my head which is basically the emotional undercurrents of this movie extrapolated everywhere. Couples I see walking together on the street. The movement my feet make after I get out of my car. Angles of eyes and insignificant adjustments of posture. Layers of fog on glass. Judgements of men and slowly of women. Never have I felt more at home than when I'm watching a movie I know I understand. Gravel roads out in the country spraying over hills where I stand to the side so cars don't hit me. I want to live inside it forever.",
