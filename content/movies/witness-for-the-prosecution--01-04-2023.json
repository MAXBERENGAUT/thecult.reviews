  "body": "The blocking and scene building are very high level, and Â plot machinations succeed at almost every possible level. The acting across the board is phenomenal. Billy Wilder is a fantastic director. While the phrase legal thriller does not usually bring with it an actually thrilling sense, it does indicate a slow-burn tenacity which either works or doesn't work. This one works. Marlene Dietrich and Charles Laughton star across from each other as the 'Femme Fatale' and the 'Romantic Protagonist', the latter not actually sexually romantic but spiritually so, acting out of a powerful sense of both personal ability and moral grit, as the dense undertakings of the story sweep the audience away. There are unique details in every single minor character, a sign of Agatha Christie's great artistic brain.",
