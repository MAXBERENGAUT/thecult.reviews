  "body": "Akira Kurosawa has made two color large-scale Samurai films (to my knowledge). Ran is the lesser one. Its Shakespearean inspiration works to a degree but despite the brilliant and beautiful direction and cinematography, it is hard to relate emotionally to the characters, especially the king himself. Deaths happen in a naturalistic way that deemphasizes the emotional toll of the deaths, eventually creating a movie that by the last hour of its nearly 3-hour run time exists without characters. The king is crazy, the good son is nowhere to be seen, the other sons and their wife are boring, the guy with no eyes still has no eyes and its psychological insight and philosophical inquiry while remaining interesting has no real dramatic weight to it. This is all my opinion, and if you really love Ran and believe it to be in the top 5 of his movies, I hold no grudge against you, but if you havenâ€™t already you should watch Kagemusha.",
