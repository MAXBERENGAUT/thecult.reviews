  "body": "Casting is really important, and this movie doesn't really get it right with its leads. I won't blame them though, at least not at first, I will say that the script and the director need to understand characters in ways that benefit the actors vast amounts of emotional depth. Don't get me wrong, I like comedies, but most things that are actually interesting need to be presented realistically and not jovially. I don't care that box office returns suggest I'm in the minority with that opinion, it's still true, seriously I promise you. I think this movie is funny, but not funny enough to make up for its lack of any real mystery or suspense, its like when you like you go to the store and talk to someone in the line politely, you know you never really feel like you've met your next best friend. Sam Rockwell is a limited actor. Saoirse Ronan isn't, but here it feels like she is choosing to be. Both are very talented, and so are the rest of the cast, David Oyelowo is pretty funny, but the narrative just isn't interesting enough. 'Knives Out,' I guess the blueprint for this movie, had much more going on than it looked like, here they take the aesthetic and some name-brand actors and hope for some kind of blue equanimity outside the world of financial balance sheets. You've got to want to do something new!",
