  "body": "Except for the bad CGI this would be a great movie. I mean, like, the cliff, the rain, the boat, that weird cave scene, and worst of all that car ride with the warden. It's still nice though. It scratches an itch, it's pleasant and only sometimes difficult. The hard parts, the good parts, come through very accessibly. Mark Ruffalo's character is obviously difficult to write, but they could've given him more, he can handle smarty pants stuff, you didn't have to treat him with kid gloves. It's so good I want to burn it down and start it over from scratch to see if I can get around the parts I want to get around. It makes me think of the transition from spring into summer and that wilting sense of lost self-belief and eternal obsolescence while the world churns slowly, devolving into a bitter copy of the ideas people once held young in flesh as I still am. I might be young but I'll never be happy. I'll always find something wrong with the past. It will flow, flee away, I will stay while it recedes, the sky gets blue and then dark when I stay awake.",
