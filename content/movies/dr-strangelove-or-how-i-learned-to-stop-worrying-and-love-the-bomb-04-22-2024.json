  "body": "Dr. Strangelove is a good movie but I still went on my phone and played an arcadey basketball game that's addicting (though I'm getting bored) for maybe fifteen to twenty percent of it. I don't do it with books but I guess I do it with movies. Avoided watching it for that exact same reason, maybe. Love and sex are so much more interesting but I don't do them either. Very well shot, edited, segmented, filtered, conceptualized; it's the definition of dedication in craftsmanship. But I don't really care. Life is not a sequence of decision-making, nor is it about cleanliness in political presentation. Probably difficult to judge outside of its momentâ€”then I would likely have been ecstatic over it. Cigarette, wash my family shame, stupid mistakes that make me want to never get out of bed. Will though, will. Think too much of past loves, too too much. Acknowledge, experience, release. I still think about the block where I broke your heart, baby don't hurt me.",
