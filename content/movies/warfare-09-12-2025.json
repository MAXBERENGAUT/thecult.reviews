  "body": "I liked this movie; aspects were entertaining. I guess it didn't really reveal anything to me. This is what I would expect of a Navy Seal operation in the middle east. The acting is what I'd expect, the writing is fine. The direction and cinematography are nice: it's a decent B-movie. When everyone leaves at the end, it's hard to care. They came, did nothing, got blown up a bit, and left. The guy in charge can't handle it. It's very slightly implied to be the result of his superiors blaming him for fucking up. It's funny how they call for med-evac as a guy has some blood on his hand. Like what? I like the idea for the movie though.",
