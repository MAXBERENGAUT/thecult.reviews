  "body": "I've been thinking about Bob Dylan lately, don't know why. Why is there not more made of his work ethic? It's one thing to have talent and another to make the most of it. Somehow I hadn't heard his song that opens the movie, which somehow I hadn't seen. The opening half an hour or so is brilliant, great, great literature. The rest is good, but that opening! New year's resolution: figure out my thing with my mom. I went through my stories today and I think that's the last piece to make them complete but then again completeness isn't my strong suit. I have talent but not work ethic or that residual carnivorous gene this movie sees and understands of reality-based male nature. The funny thing about the Coen bros is the weaknesses. They don't matter, their matter still exists! It exists, it exists, devil may care, whatever the people may think, they exist. Very funny, shame they don't or didn't have that last great bit of ambition to be different or eternal but that's rare and really not that big a deal at the end of the year (or time). Julianne Moore, right. Julianne Moore. Bridges, Goodman, Thewlis, Hoffman, probably someone else too â€“ the PTA cast thing. Scripts I guess? Don't know.",
