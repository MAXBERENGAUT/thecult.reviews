  "body": "Narrative lines, they're like mathematical equations. The problem with America today is that people satisfy themselves with 2 + 2 = 4. That's dumb; orcas probably know how to do 3x + 2 = 8, they might even know 3x^2 = 27, or some other pre-algebraic test matter, so why assume incompetence for the most intellectually capital rich animal species. Libidinal seriousness, that's adult but it's really adolescent. Marvel movies can do linear regression but they don't even do variables. Make no mistake, L.A. Confidential is a comic book movie and I love comic book movies. The violence is really only a shade darker, there is like one character death, Marvel movies usually have more! Not everyone pays attention to their phone, and even if they do, that's no excuse. I write for an audience of one and I don't care about the financial consequences of my born creativity, I couldn't care less, there's more important things in life. Hollywood is a dirty word, it doesn't mean anything at the end of the day. When we die, we're no longer alive, so I live for beauty and other people, other things, other ideas and my own.",
