  "body": "Tï»¿he hoodie I'm wearing right now has coffee stains down its front. I missed the first 15 minutes of Aftersun when I watched it last night so I watched the rest of it this morning. It's a movie about deep searing loss that never addresses its topic head on. Instead, it writes about it like a poem would. The photography is beautiful and emotionally distant. Its actors, especially Paul Mescal, play the material in a detached, withdrawn way. Together with its stream-of-consciousness storytelling, the film becomes a distinct, nostalgic, sad, continuous dream. Its location, a Turkey beach resort, is perhaps one of the most perfectly etched film settings that I've seen. It is like the island in 'Persona', the house in the hayfields in 'Days of Heaven', and Taipei in 'Yi Yi'. I always felt like crying even though there was nothing really to make me cry. Just the tone.",
