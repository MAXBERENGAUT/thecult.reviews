  "body": "Thursday I'll be a year sober. Still got a lot of work to do but I'm grateful for the change sobriety/AA/recovery has brought me. This is a dumb fucking movie. Some parts (aspects) are really cool. But it's dumb. I thought Meryl Streep was pretty hot. De Niro and Walken were too I guess but I didn't really care. Haha. Heterosexuality, attraction to women, normie behavior really. Good thing women exist so all that attraction isn't wasted. I fall in love with a girl every fortnight or two. UVA sent me an email of their mascot and it actually didn't bother me as much as my psychiatrist would assume it might. Psychosis/SI/delusional thinking/pain nowhere to be seen! Haha. The mascot says writing is the future, good luck bitch! Really I SHOULD be working twice as hard as you, so it's a good reminder despite your ugly fucking style and personality and stupid fucking hair, bitch, bitch!!",
