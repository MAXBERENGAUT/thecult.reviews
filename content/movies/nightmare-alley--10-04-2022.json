  "body": "Nightmare Alley is an interesting movie because for some reason it decides in the middle of the story to skip ahead two years, and then tell the story from there and literally do nothing about those missing two years. It's a really weird narrative glitch. The opening of the movie is great, it's almost impressionistic at times, and the violence is cartoonish yet still visceral. The carnival stage is set really well. Things are spooky and potentially very interesting. Bradley Cooper meets Rooney Mara, and they fall in love. Somewhere along the way we realize Bradley Cooper really likes money, and then soon after, the time skip happens. Here we meet Cate Blanchett, who is remembering 'Carol' while performing, and not really anything nearly as interesting as the carnival (no offense to her). I enjoyed this movie but I thought its cinematography was a little basic and I think set design wise this movie kills it, saving a lot of what could have possibly gone wrong. Bradley Cooper is a good actor, actually every one of these actors is a good actor, and they all do a good job. However, sometimes the audience's suspension of disbelief matters mostly with if they feel like they're getting what they signed up for. I got what I wanted at times, but at others I felt bored. I still love the overall artistic intent and production value though, and I hope more movies like this one come out.",
