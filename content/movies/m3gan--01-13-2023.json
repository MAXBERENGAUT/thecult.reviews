  "body": "Horror movies tend to do well at the box-office. A lot of this is because they deliver cheap thrills. M3gan delivers cheap thrills and at times is funny and amusing. It is also not really a good movie. It’s run of the mill in places where it has no need to be. The final fight sequence is built from the skeleton of every single Marvel movie ever made, and as the exposition feels indebted to ‘Silicon Valley’, any place story-wise it actually does anything new is surrounded by a field of sentiment. The doll, a nicely performed horror monster, seems to understand the comedic undertones of the material, and the actors (Allison Williams, Ronny Chieng) seem to as well. I liked watching M3gan but I will never see anything of it again and I was bored frankly by its relative ingenuity in the context of the even more boring landscape of cinema.",
