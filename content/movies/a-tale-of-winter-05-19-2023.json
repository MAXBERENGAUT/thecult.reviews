  "body": "Eric Rohmer makes artistically perfect movies. The cinematography, writing, and its consumer experience are heavenly. It's like a warm bath. He is one of my favorite directors, if not the favorite, as his interest lies in every day male-female romantic relationships, almost Austenian in its artistic purity. A Tale of Winter is about a young woman with three men in her life, one of them a phantom memory, and the others only parts of that perfect man. Like all Rohmer films, characters reveal the human specificity of their relationships (and thus themselves) through complex, utopian, dialogue. Human beings don't really talk like this. We're too dumb and too reliant on social conventions. But life would be magical if we could. Once again, France is made into beauty incarnate, this time in the cold.",
