  "body": "I took a class on the Indian economy in my last semester of college. This movie would not fit seamlessly into its overarching perspective, it's too deferential to Western ideas of a developing economy particularly its (the movie's) avoidance of the relationship India had in the 1950's to the Soviet Union style of a command economy which is never mentioned and hardly ever alluded to. What makes The Big City special is the rare and unique treatment of subtle family dynamics through picture perfect scene and photography design, not necessarily its interest in mapping the transition from rural to urban life which is really more of a bullet point in the scope of the story instead the more complex nexus of relationships between all the family members and really every single character. It's almost an old-style Russian novel in story design, not an allegory for social mobility which I figure is the most common critical analysis consensus. Lead actress so hot, lead actor so cool, bet no one noticed. Beautiful movie.",
