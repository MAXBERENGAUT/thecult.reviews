  "body": "I don't really want to talk about this movie so I'm going to talk about A24. This is all without research. It started, you know, made a name for itself with Hereditary. Then, Midsommar, as a sort of sequel. Knives Out? I don't know, perhaps. It was the same kind of actors and intelligible storytelling, moneyed production quality, and then, in a blink of an eye it was a name brand and an internet institution. So then comes Friendship, a movie that shouldn't really exist. Tim Robinson is funny but he's not a movie star. This movie is funny but it's not really even a movie. There is no real storytelling. I don't mean the stupid did characters change quota, I mean things don't have a point except to be funny, which is fine, but that doesn't mesh at all with the patented A24 b-movie style photography. Like, Paul Rudd? Kate Mara is in a different, better movie. I really really liked that joke about the economy during the 70s; it was really funny. Robinson's problem is that his characters just aren't human, he just can't preform that way. But A24 funded this movie because their whole life they've given to the artist underbelly of Hollywood a shoddily written contract to make a difference, they've made a living off our interest in new art but never really took time to sit with it.",
