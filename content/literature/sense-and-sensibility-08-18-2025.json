  "body": "Thinking about Jane Austen, it would make sense for ------ to have a lot more space and time devoted to it. Thinking about the moment with Edward and the sheath and scissors, it was done in a way that I totally understood it in the moment but later when put under a fatuous, academic addendum critical microscope, it made sense to me to be a symbolic violent thing. My writing, for ------, doesn’t work like that. It’s meant to be a lot more beautiful and also immediate, less time-staking, but it would probably be its best form if there’s this subtle slowness to it. It’s not like Sense and Sensibility is a slow read. I liked the scene where Willoughby comes back, it’s strange but it also makes the story better and less obvious. I guess? the Jane Austen critical society frowns on it because, as that guy at the end says, of the ending, where it’s too quick and uneasy the conclusion, and probably a part of that is the sense from it that this is sort of commercial enjoyment, where in real life Edward yeah probably would marry Lucy, and their family would kind of suffer. My favorite part of Jane Austen, past the characterization, and the simple effective storytelling, is the sentences that are needlessly complicated. Which then make me in actual life talk too formal and also wordy. But it’s almost as if she wants to show off what her brain can do, and I like that. Honestly the most annoying part of this book was the use of commas which I didn’t remember from other Jane Austen books I read. Just bad.",
