  "body": "The Lady in the Lake is really a great book. The Little Sister is really a fun book. The Long Goodbye is a long read with something strange at the center, and Playback is written to be a coda. Whenever Chandler tries to give Marlow anything explicit personality-wise it feels not literary. The literary parts aren't really the writing -- which is fine -- but the storytelling. There's style of course in the overall approach but what I liked the most was the randomness of its euphoric moments. The whole mountain town is great but so are the film studio and Santa Monica moments, the storytelling about what happens and happened in a house on a lake in Encino and I guess in Playback the way the opening rattles its cage trying to find and escape from what the author knows is inevitable. There's a lot of characters and there's often something intriguing about them, there's an endless cascade of women. At its best is just feels so cozy. He's a good writer.",
