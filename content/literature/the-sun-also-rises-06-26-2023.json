  "body": "Tï»¿his book is not really as interesting as it could be. There are only one or two interesting characters, maybe three, but the dialogue persists as if every word spoken was approaching brilliance. It concerns young adults who drink and party and sightsee and abuse one another. Racial epithets, stereotypes, ideas, are common and portrayed matter-of-factly as if they were just the way things were. A lot of time is spent describing scenery. However, it is a fast and entertaining read. Its opening line is genius, as is its way of concluding scenes and ideas through chapter breaks. The narrator is a lively host but only sometimes reveals insight into why he is the way he is. The prose is intentionally 'bankrupt' of any superfluousness. I believed it, at certain times I felt as if it was really happening. But I never thought it was as piercing within its context as it seems to think it is. The artistic heart is obviously below the surface but often that surface is 'utilized' as if it actually had narrative weight. He reminds me of Tarantino. Still, as already said, it was well-done for what it was."
