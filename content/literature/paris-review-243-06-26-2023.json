  "body": "Virginia Woolf once said of Jane Austen that one of her finest skills was the ability to characterize through (silent) criticism. In the spirit of one of the greatest writers of all time, I will purge through the Spring 2023 issue of this esteemed literary magazine. The art is interesting, sometimes alluring, though never euphoric. The poetry is uniformly strong, though I know nothing of poetry, I liked the psychological sprawl of Malachi Black's 'Holding a Book I haven't Read for Many Years', the humor of 'John Wick Is So Tired' by Kyra Wilder, the insight of 'A Green Dream' by Uche Nduka and the architectural imagery of Tracy Fuad's 'Birth'. As for the interviews: Mary Gaitskill's undeniable coolness (both personally and in her writing style) makes for strong content, Rita Dove's infuriates me because I never took her class and her insight seems so invaluable, and Olga Tokarczuk was new to me but seems to have this sense of indelible strangeness to her that very likely makes for good literary art though I was somewhat put off by the combination of contemporary political intelligence (Faulkner is smartly described as 'indigestible') with childish fascination in spirits and astrology. Now, for the stories, I'm going to be harsh. Rivers Solomon's 'This is Everything There Ever Will Be' is smart and well-made but frustratingly tacky (woah, she likes basketball, woahhh), Elisa Gonzalez's 'Sanctuary' is memorable but misandristic, Elaine Feeney's 'Same, Same' is lethargic but fitting, Daniel Mason's 'A Case Study' is somewhat interesting but opaque, and my favorite, 'Irreproachable', by Marie NDiaye is somehow both magestic and politically insightful. So much art! So much!"
