  "score": 10,
  "body": "I started this book two and a half years ago and have now finished it so while it’s my favorite ever work of literary art—and Chekhov is in my top five—the following ranking is meant to be conjunctural: \n\n1. My Life\n2. Steppe\n3. The Duel\n4. An Official Duty\n5. The House with the Mezzanine\n6. The Bride\n7. Ariadna\n8. Ionych\n9. A Visit to Friends\n10. In the Ravine\n11. Peasants\n12. The Lady with the Dog\n13. The Black Monk\n14. Ward No.6\n15. The Little Trilogy\n16. The Bishop\n17. The Student\n18. A Dreary Story\n\nThe crazy thing is that even the bottom of the list is fantastic. His emotional power, capable of the most searing personal feeling from a simple turn of phrase, seems to essentially be his born personality. His talent is indescribable. One page of his unique sensibility is worth millions. His ability for insight, subtlety, character, empathy, and storytelling has few comparisons. I can only think of four. Austen, Munro, Hardy, and Lawrence. So top five.",
