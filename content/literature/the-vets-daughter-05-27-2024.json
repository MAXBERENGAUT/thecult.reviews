  "body": "A great, sudden book which surprised me because I thought its literary simplicity was a sign of no imagination. There is really a lot of really nice writing, I liked the island and the travel around London the most. Her father is really a great character, there are maybe six or seven great characters. It's short but it's quite descriptively dense. I don't care for science fiction, generally, but that's because I don't read for entertainment I selfishly read for self-betterment. Comyns makes me anxious, it's a dirty sort of gift, her prose, in the best senses of those words. I think maybe she ended it because she was exhausted. Perhaps she got hooked on the floating too much, it's implied to be only one aspect of her powers, only one maybe more obvious and immediate, but the steaming water, for example, that was great. But it makes sense for the character of course, and for the book too given it's in first person. The detail of an evil vet's home is genius. I also liked the author's foreword, it was interesting and somewhat unusual but welcome.",
