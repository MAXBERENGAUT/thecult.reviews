  "body": "Tï»¿he style of this book is a little hard to explain. It needs to be listened to. And I don't mean in the audiobook way, that's probably not going to work. It exists in a dystopian universe where the only vehicle of speech is absurdist free-association prose. There are sections, titled even, but this is not a short story collection. It is a piece of writing art without any feet on its ground. New York City is combined into Paris. Ideas are generally hard to understand, but easy to follow. Intrigued, I tried to write my own sort of Henry Miller free-association but I only found garbage. What he's doing is not only insane it's incredibly difficult to pull off. Adjectives are fixed to subjects, metaphors are fixed to images, in ways that consistently innovate. Different, but always int he same lovely style. His brain seems to have found a way to empty itself onto the page without a modicum of filter. His natural rhythm as a writer is truly fantastic. Its euphoric moments are stumbled upon. It's hard to read. I think I found it fascinating but I don't really know.",
