  "body": "My first understanding of Mad Men was that it asked, what if a man was a brilliant artist who's art was purely and always commercial? that is, what is a man like that life's like? and it answered that question with strong presentation and interesting writing. Then the show changed, somewhere around Season 3 and then really changed in Season 4. It became instead of a solitary question with scene character and story design a much larger and self-serious story in scope. It instead became about the American condition. The later seasons always have good endings but they never really ask questions like the first seasons did. Don is always relatable and funny, I like the flashbacks but the hallucinations got pretty tiring. An aspect that I think got somewhat muddled in the later seasons was the feeling of their office world wandering out into the real world, of it unintentionally bleeding, rather than a much more tiring attempt to say these two worlds are the same. Further, I think by the end the show was really more about working in an office with other people. The show has really beautiful moments of emotion and artistic sensibility, it can touch deep recesses, and it's funny and compelling. I guess I mean in early seasons I was really excited for the plot arcs, then I eventually grew bored. But then again I watched the whole show in about a month.",
