  "body": "In the past 6 months I have fundamentally lost control of my mental health. I have no one else to blame but myself. I am sorry for everyone who I have hurt with my writing recently and I wish I could have it back. I have updated some of the reviews I felt were personally unacceptable. If any one feels the need to let me know of further mistakes I've made with my writing that they wish me to fix, you can reach out at thecultreviews@gmail.com. I started this website because I am personally fond of art criticism, and I do not apologize for my interest, nor do I feel I should be restricted in what art I cover or not cover. At the same time I am fully responsible for its content, and if people take offense to my writing, I apologize. Please let me know, it is admittedly difficult for me to know otherwise. Also, if any one would like to add their personal sections, as in anime, memes, tweets, politics, food, toothpastes, people, drinks, or add their own reviews to my already established sections, I am happy to put you on you need only ask.",
