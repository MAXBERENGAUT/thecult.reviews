  "body": "I'm not super picky when it comes to music. My time in college has taught me that the simple check of whether or not I like consuming it, art, is all I need to solidify confidence in my personal taste. As far as my brain's concerned, 'Black Country', '5ft7', 'Welsh Souper', 'Midnite Cobras', 'Walken with Jesus', and 'Softly Kidding' are worthy of all the good lord's praises. These are songs like Battles's 'Atlas' and 'Ice Cream' which rise above the common doldrums of Western contemporary music to create something brilliantly and uniquely wonderful. It's a shame the other songs kind of suck, but hey, nobody's perfect.",
