  "body": "thanks to my sponsor ive been getting more into electronic music. teengirl fantasy is an interesting group, their first album is by far my favorite, and i don't really like any of their other stuff. really cool sounds and just in general pop. need to respond to people. got a cool position nowadays. need to keep it up, keep up calling and talking to other people, one day ill be happy, and im happy now but im not ecstatic. submitted a short story to the drift. haven't heard back, it's been about a week. so i guess it's a no go. not really sure if my fiction has a future but ill keep working on it. \"now that's what i call, vol. 2\", \"hoop dreams\", and \"portofino\". the other songs besides azz klapz are good too. azz klapz is too freaky for me. im just a basic kid, jacking off to girls i know, waiting around for sex but eventually ill start pushing myself towards sex in a reasonable way. havent had sex sober in five years and havent had sex in general for about two. dont think ive even kissed since then either. huh! whatever. not hurt or resentful, just a little dismayed i guess by my self-preservational instincts. but it's not a big deal, i think sex is cool, maybe love a bit better but that is sex so... looking for guidance and hope to find it in the details of human connection. sponsor not totally on board with my electronic music taste, he's more a clubby guy, he's like one of the coolest guys i ever met, glad i have to call him and find out on a daily basis that cool guys aren't intimidating, though it's sad how many parties they go to and how few i do. not really sad, just like: huh, i guess there's benefits to being social and fun. haha--- saw a tweet about cults and thought about aa and realize that im an alcoholic looking for any reason not to be sober, even though it's really changed my life from a hole to a ranch. a stable, you know. fuck my coworker he real life knows nothing about art, my friend cool though - my coworker friend - he cool - but my coworker aint! getting a new computer, should finish some movies soon.",
