  "body": "Tek lintowe was born the same year I was and seems completely currently incapable of putting things to rest. His talent and artistic vision for sound is essentially in a class of its own for new-wave soundcloud music. But that doesn't mean he's doing a great job. In a post calling the kids like him fags on his twitter he complains about how his art can't possibly be as important as his viral personality. It's the sort of problem all soundcloud personalities face: the lack of ubiquity despite artistic success. For me the problem is more of how it affects already nervous volatile mental states like his. Essentially this whole scene, Shed, so evil boyz, 1c, other more conventional rappers, randoms like harto, all of them; is on the underground path to fame where people who care care and people who don't don't. This might be their peak, or they might blow up like Lil Peep or Odd Future, it depends on the youth—which none of them are—and not really their music though I guess it helps. There's some cool songs here and I'll listen to what he drops in the future but really this guy needs to strap himself in and stop talking. Balance is like his Testing so maybe he knocks up Clairo or something in the future who knows.",
