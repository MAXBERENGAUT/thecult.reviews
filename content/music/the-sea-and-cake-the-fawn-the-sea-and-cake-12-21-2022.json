  "body": "The Sea and Cake are a weird little group. They make indie music for hotel lobbies. And it's good. Songs like the 'Argument,' 'There You Are', and 'Bird and Flag' are epics of the indie rock canon, tracks containing the great spread of human emotion and intellectual certainty in their grasp, all embedded into their soft jazz-rock sonic environment. I certainly wouldn't expect the confidence on display here if I heard in a bar bathroom hallway a short summary of their artistic ethos, but from the cover alone you see that these guys are built a little different. 'Sporting Life', 'The Fawn', 'The Ravine', 'Rossignol', Civilise', 'Black Tree in the Bee yard', and, finally, 'Do Now Fairly Well'.",
