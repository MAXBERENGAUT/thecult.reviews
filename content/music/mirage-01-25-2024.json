  "body": "I'm not sure what the point is exactly to caring about the things I do. My life is hopeless, but I see forward progress. I've started a job—and it's fun. Learning a lot. Becoming a better person and a better man. Growing up. Apple Music has a cool Discovery Weekly like station that works! Hooky came out with their first album since 2021. I really liked, loved, their first three. I feel bad that they're not big, they deserve to be. This is the best dream pop this side of the 2010s. I was watching the music video for Range Life the other day and I realized that our contemporary music ecosystem—and artistic ecosystem—prevents things like that from becoming big. This is great music, art, whatever you want to call it. I've never heard indie music so good at reimagining the toughness of trap music. '3AM', 'Operation', 'Pix', 'Heart Eyes', 'Angel Style', 'Fucking Up', 'World Piece', 'Company', 'Mirror', 'Shrinkmaster', 'Enter Capman', 'Goodbye'. I love it. Enter Capman is one of those songs, and the one following it, with its titular implication, that makes me sad. People listen, people care, this is great music guys! You will get what you deserve, I will make sure of it. I promise. Keep doing your thing. Love.",
