  "body": "\"I / Never knew you / Had it in you / To make enemies / Natural abilities.\" Computerwife is the solo project of Addie Warncke and this is her self-titled debut album. Her 2020 song 'Leave Me Be' was and is ingeniously angry, a modern classic, with vocal hook after vocal hook, essentially perfect. This is her first music in three years. The best songs here, 'Vacation' (\"All I know is I wanna be like you\"), 'You Make It Look So Easy' (\"You are so superior to me\"), 'I Get Better Everyday' (\"Maybe I am malinformed\"), are genuine and wonderful, but she was always pretty good at singles. I've been listening to this album on repeat because it is good in its entirety. I sing it out loud. All of it. Her best talent is for cascading vocal melodies, there's something of Ovlov and Os Mutantes here. There's the female indie heritage of course, early Snail Mail, Liz Phair, Ivy, and the Breeders but I think what I like the most is the sort of natural feeling for texture and technique that Alex G and artists like feardorian make a living off of. If there's any limit to this music it's its lack of ambition. There is no reason why Computerwife can't put more into it. Songs like the Green Day fan-song 'Oops' and the one-note garble of 'Happy Girl' are not bad songs, they don't ruin the project or anything, but they take up space in a way that's like settling for mid-range jumpers the defense is more than happy to give you. One of my favorite albums of the year.",
