  "body": "I don't like the term 'album', or 'record', or 'mixtape'. I like 'project'. Icedancer is one of the best projects of all time, but under the other terms that label would feel ridiculous. It shouldn't. Front to back this thing is unbelievable in its scope. About four or five of these songs feel like they shouldn't exist at all. It takes everything he's built before and reimagines it in a crystal fortress of synths. Its best songs: Okk, Smartwater, Close, Be Nice 2 Me, Waster, DG Jeans, For Nothing, Cartier'god intermission, have hooks cerebrally inserted into all of its components. Intros, outros, bridges, verses, the hooks themselves, the album itself, all of it feels like a never ending story. The lyrics are dreamy and beautiful, materialistic but never hollow, depressively romantic without being repulsive. At the time, he was a rare romantic figure for young men, someone creative who was neither a joke or a fake. (This cool Swedish guy hates himself (around women) just like me). \"It will be cold at night. Why would I lie?\""
