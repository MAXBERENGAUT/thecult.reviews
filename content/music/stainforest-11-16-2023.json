  "body": "Who cares really if things aren't the way they could be. Hard to deny music that works. Especially music that represents something new. elibanss has an interesting style that uses a vocal technique like 90's alt rockers but with modern Soundcloud rap production that has complex melody and addictive drums. Momentum, artistic. Lyrically he could say more things that make him different. I don't know if he dissed me like objectively it's extremely unlikely for him to know of my existence but that's what I hear. There's also a line about jews but nothing really that'd revoke a nobel prize award (jose saramago). Not defending Israel's actions in Palestine but some people are obsessed with using the holocaust against them and it's academically acceptable. Not in the 'from the river to the sea' way, that's for some reason not allowed, even though it's easily deniable, despite its whistling, but in a way that posits Israel's existence as inseparable from neoliberal misery. I believe in the existence of Israel. I believe its people and culture are real. I believe Palestine needs freedom to survive. I believe it has the right to determine its own definition of that word. I don't think these things are mutually exclusive but you know maybe I'm just half-Jewish. This music has nothing to do with anything I'm saying. Sorry I guess.",
