  "body": "The weird thing about having had developed a coping mechanism for basic life in a daily fantasy centered on future universal prestige is that most of my life and brain activity is useless. As a kid I used to dance around my room acting out dream sports scenariosâ€”interceptions like Malcom Butler's, goals like Pele's dummy in an extra time world cup final against England (goalkeeper and defender crashing into each other), dunks in March Madness for some cinderella northeast liberal arts college, even sometimes now. But I'm 23, a reporting intern, isolated, and I live with my parents. So all these fantasies are is wasted time. I figured recently that this is something different, I'm putting thoughts into communicative hieroglyphics, and however obscure and dull their publication, I am contributing something. This is a great album but I only like 3 of the 9 songs. Still great to listen to front to back, somehow. Dodos have a few albums, they got some cred for the ones before this, which were much less 'rocky', to put it obstinately. 'No Color' is art pop with a beautiful heart and aesthetic engine. 'When Will You Go' is one of the best songs of the decade. \"I hope it is.\"",
