  "body": "Inch are a small Ohio band with one EP with four songs. Their frontman Sam Rubin is a talented Soundcloud rap producer, but these four songs are very far from the sonic ecosystem he utilizes while over there. These are rock songs, indie guitar-pop songs, with ugly vocals that set in subtly just as they should. Every indie rock band needs an original vocal style, it’s one of the core tenets of the genre, in that without it there isn’t really any difference between any of these songs. Sure, there might be relatively minute production style differences, which bring the ‘edge’ to indie rock music, but the heart of the art is always in the vocal style. Guitars should not change much from band to band, they need original melodies of course, but their sonic style seems almost impossible to further improve. Where else on earth could guitar-pop artists possibly go after Ceremony by New Order? The secret of indie rock is in the unique and charming combination of those two main building blocks, and Inch, over four lo-fi rock songs, show they have it in spades. Inch take the best of garage rock stalwarts like Wavves and Guided By Voices, and combine it with an idealistic artistic sensibility not unlike Forth Wanderers. ‘Support’ is a barn-stormer, ‘Killer’ is a slow epic, ‘Dry Heaving’ is a nice shoegaze pop song, and its best song, ‘Attack’, is what happens when you make songs with heart, skill, and energy: great pop music."
