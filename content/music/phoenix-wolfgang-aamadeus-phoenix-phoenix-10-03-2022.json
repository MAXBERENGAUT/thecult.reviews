Surprisingly, indie pop like Phoenix, the Strokes, Vampire Weekend, Arctic Monkeys, and even the Black Keys, is mainstream. I was young then, and in my own world, so I felt I was likely the only one who thought this music rocked. When I started to encounter it without making the active choice too, I realized that bands like 'Phoenix', musical acts which I recognized as unique artistic individuals, were known as the nondescript group 'Phoenix' who created crossover hits like 'Liztomania' and '1901'. 'Lasso' was my first encounter with them, I heard it on SiriusXM altnation, and when I got the chance I pirated the album so I could listen to it on my ride into school. I love every song on this project. 'Liztomania', '1901', and 'Lasso' are just as good as 'Fences' and 'Love like a Sunset' and 'Rome' and 'Girlfriend' and, finally, 'Armistice'. It's great music, modern and sophisticated, brilliant and heart-wormy, flat-out perfect encapsulations of ephemeral moods and a uniquely inward energy."
