  "artist": "The Simps",
  "album": "Siblings",
  "body": "Eyedress arrived in 2019 individually capable of both indie rock classics ('Jealous') and cloud rap bops ('Sweet Shawty'). In the years since he has spread his artistry even further out across the ether, clearly following his whims and without a thought to the Pitchfork type legacy some alternative groups aspire too. This is where the Simps come in, a collab project with non-binary artist Zzzahara which finds sad-boy (girl) indie rock to be the most interesting musical genre at the time of making it.  About 80% of these songs are decent, nothing too special, but its best songs '666', 'On Fye', 'Tesla' and 'Green Eyed Girl' are amazing and endlessly replay-able."
