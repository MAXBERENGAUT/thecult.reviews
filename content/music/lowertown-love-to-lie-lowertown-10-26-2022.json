  "body": "All of these songs have a heart to them. Both members are instinctually very talented, their guitars and vocals are both equally seductive, and the songs themselves are hard to pin down exactly. Sometimes they float or fluctuate between moods, but often they're catchy and fun to listen too. Like all good music the hooks are built into its intrinsic sonic and narrative elements. Olivia Osby has an interestingly literal vocal style which rewards itself constantly as it gets more and more ecstatic and farfetched. Her lyrics, sometimes lucidly erotic, are about understanding yourself in your brain as you become an adult. They are always unique and well-observed. 'The Gaping Mouth', their standout track from their last project, is bested three or four times over. 'Waltz in Aflat Major', 'Bucktooth' (what she say?), 'No Way', 'Antibiotics', 'My Friends', 'I'm Not', 'At the End', 'It's It's It's', 'Goon', 'It's Easy For Me'."
