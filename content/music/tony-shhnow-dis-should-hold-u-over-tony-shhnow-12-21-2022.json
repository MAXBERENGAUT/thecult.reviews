  "body": "Great rappers always have to come out of nowhere. Bar after bar, song after song, hook after hook, Tony Shhnow remains interesting. It's a miracle. The sophisticated timing Tony wields matches in step his humor and lyrical creativity. The beats, all made by SoundCloud legend CashCache, are euphoric masterpieces. They turn his inventive one-liners into catchiness, transform his diarisms into indispensable words of wisdom. Every song is a bonafide underground classic. Unfortunately for Tony, his recent projects seem to imply the sonic perfect on show here is a one-off. Sometimes it seems as if he's run out of new things to say, that he ever comes across pathetic, and I'm worried about his artistic vision. In interviews he explains his lower middle-class upbringing like Dave Chappelle did, and his 'involvement' with a life of crime seems more like a bargaining chip in his claim for fame than an artistic weapon."
