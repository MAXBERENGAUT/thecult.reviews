I like this project though, a collab between Tek Lintowe and the slurry rapper Woody (Dream Caster) who together make nice music. Beats are carefully chosen, flows are interesting, hooks come easily, as the cloud-rap aesthetic is taken to its artistic limits. Lyrics are what make music stick, and these guys, by guys I mean Tek, Woody, Laker, Joeey, and Ricky Chix, are good at them. On 'Clutch' there's the line \"tell me why the government left all this money in my bag\", on the amazing 'I usd to sleep' there's \"I used to sleep on a bed made of plywood\" and \"I can tell Joeey walked in the room because he put his ds next to me\", on 'Crystal hands' there's \"I know what I am but who I'll be I figure out\", and on the excellent 'Tek on me' there's \"I know this process like the back of my hand\" and \"Yeah I will not blow, I wouldn't bank on it, noooooh oh\". Catchy melody comes easily to these guys. Their interplay, lyrical and melodic teamwork, make the music very replayable. Their music videos also show nice aesthetic skills, I would be surprised if this was the biggest they ever got to be.",
