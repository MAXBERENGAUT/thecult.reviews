  "body": "Iï»¿ like the movie Ratatouille because it's about art. I tend like any sort of media entertainment that's about art. Often, it's because if something cares about art it cares about itself. The Cradle, the one-man-Brooklyn-band helmed by Paco Cathcart, has released an extended full-length project entirely predicated on the joy of art. For him, and for me, as a specific music enjoyer, American pop music is not bad at all, it's not good either but it's necessary in the same way that brushing your teeth is, and so forward-thinking and experimental music has no real need or urgency to shun that tide of human society if it wants to exist. And that's all 'Radio Wars' wants to do, exist, inside its little esoteric ecosystem. Not every song hits but the vast majority do and you immediately get the sense of an original cross between Bon Iver and that 'Discovery' LP by Rostam Batmanglij and Wes Miles. There's also some Sufjan Stevens there too. That original descriptor is interesting, and it's mostly due to its sonic feel, its Southeast Asian influences, and the DIY/Cloud Rap production aesthetic that I feel confident labeling as such. Songs like 'Lights Off', 'Ha Ha Ha!', 'My Right Side', 'American Spirit', 'I Went in and You Came Out', 'Let's Clean Up', 'City Life', 'I Love That Music' and 'I Love the World I'm In' are some of the most original interpretations of pop music I've heard on a single project in a long while."
