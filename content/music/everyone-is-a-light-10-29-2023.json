Juvenile perspectives on sexuality - if it doesn't fit into a common social media perspective it's not valuable - take everyone for granted by viewing them incapable of having nuance to their sexuality. Take this album, for example. It's 12 great songs about how sexuality is not good. It's not saying it's bad or that it should be avoided. It's saying it's not good. It's saying that taking the world from an objectively juvenile point of view misses the bigger picture. Sex with someone who makes you feel bad is not good even though it's sex. I know you think that's impossible. You don't think sex can't be good. You don't think sexual satisfaction can ever have negative side effects. You think, because, at the end of the day, you have the right to, that men who aren't what you expect of men are closeted. You love that term. Closeted. It gives you the power. Without it and its social insult you would have to sit at the same table as those men. Equality is a weapon used by the world to make people like you feel powerless. I'll never write for anyone else besides myself. Maybe someone will publish my fiction but my fiction deserves to be separated from who (what) I am. \"Someone needs to teach these boys (writers) some manners.\"",
