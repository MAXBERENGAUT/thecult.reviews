  "body": "After making mainstream hip-hop's first coming out album with the surprisingly well thought-out 'Flower Boy', Tyler finds himself at a bit of a crossroads with Igor. Bisexuality is fascinating artistic subject matter, but he'd already explored his own complicated relationship with sexuality, and as a creative he had no other choice but to go in a new direction. It turns out, that direction was pretty-much useless. These are romantically dry songs about a guy who couldn't care less. The features and production are stadium-tour ready ('New Magic Wand, 'Earfquake'), but where is the introspection? Where is the rapping? Did he run out of cute white boys he could name drop? None of these songs are bad but all of them are pointless. Personally, I'd like to learn more about him, as he seems interesting, but if I listen to Igor all I learn is he pines for certain men like I pine for certain women. Unsuccessfully. That's not connection that's just a depressingly pitiful sympathy.",
