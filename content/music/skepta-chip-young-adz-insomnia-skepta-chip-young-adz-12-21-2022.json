  "body": "'Mains' might be my most listened to song of all time. The trio collab project is unheard of in the States, for no good reason. The interplay between the three different eras of UK rap make this project consistently interesting in spite of the often dull lyrical content. If you like women being seen solely as sexual objects, or worse, as weapons to emasculate other men, then you might think these songs are epic. I don't but in every song I can't help but be impressed by their limitless energy and convincing commitment to the entire bit. The beats are sometimes wonderful, never rote, which's pretty fun. The concept for this album works but I just wish they had a little more to say. Also, the tail end of 'Intro' is genius."
