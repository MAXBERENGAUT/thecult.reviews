  "body": "The lead singer of Softie, Xavier Juarez, is not interested in being heard. His vocals are in the far back, not even barely distinguishable, but there's a soft melody to them. The bedroom pop production aesthetic is strong here, and dim scenes are made clear. The lines of guitars orchestrate the dimness, but they do not speak, they merely murk around in muck with the vocals, and it's the drums that become most resonant, then the tension of the bass line, then the neat flicker of life in a soft lead guitar, and then back to the vocals, which stretch and burn with force, despite the relative quietness. Opener 'Doser' is stunning, and once it ends, and you get into 'Schmo', 'Gifts', and 'Can I Be You', the five song project feels like a never ending halloween park ride into places familiar yet unfamiliar. Something quite impressive.",
