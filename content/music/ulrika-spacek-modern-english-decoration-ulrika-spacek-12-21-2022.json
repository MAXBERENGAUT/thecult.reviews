  "body": "'Mimi Pretend' is a classic, but what about the next nine songs? Not as good, but only just barely not as good. Wisely Ulrika Spacek can only make one type of shoegaze indie rock song so they just do it ten times over and let listeners parse what they want from it. I love the humming. It's like they knew we didn't really care about the words anyway. It's the Young Thug voice as an instrument mechanic but repurposed for dense indie rock in its genre's most classic style: pop songs. Music like this has a warmth to it that comes from nothing but its artistic seriousness. 'Ziggy', 'Everything, All the Time', 'Modern English Decoration', 'Full of Men', 'Saw a Habit Forming', 'Protestant Work Slump'.",
