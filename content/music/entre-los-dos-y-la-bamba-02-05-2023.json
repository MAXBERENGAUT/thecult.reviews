  "body": "Y La Bamba's 2019 album Entre Los Dos is a warm celebration of human joy and emotion, it is alive with the licks of human comfort, it tends to itself like a mother tends to a newborn baby. I could keep going but I've run out of dumb things to say. My favorite songs off of it, 'Entre Los Dos' and 'So√±adora' are some of the most danceable music I've ever listened too. It reminds me of 'A Personal Issue' by The Cleaners From Venus. I've been going around my apartment without any pants listening to this stuff. I can speak spanish but I can't really listen to it, so I'm not going to pretend to understand everything she's saying, but it's not hard to get the picture. Some of these songs should have been on a Fifa soundtrack back when it actually had cool music. Wooooo-oooohh. Such a nice hook. Si perderte, nuestra forma de pido que malo que something corazon. Que existe entre tu y yo, que existe entre los dos. Woo-ooh. Woo-oooh. El aire vemos sentir. They also have a nice song off their upcoming album, dibujos de mi alma, which has another really nice hook. Yo me saltere de mi ventana, que otra vida. I'm not sure what genre to call this stuff so I'm just going to call it indie rock."
