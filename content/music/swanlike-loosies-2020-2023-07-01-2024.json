  "body": "of music, all the typical imbalances seem inapposite: they are the sum total of a life's-worth of experiences and condense accessibility into microbes of lost energies â€” there is no other system but our own, it relates to a misshapen urge to correct and to withhold, where no earthly body lives. That is the stuff; that is the gist. Swanlike is nice, wide, heavy, interesting, and consistently unremarkable. With the exception of egyptian ratscrew there's nothing to send to a friend. That's great, it's a lost VHS tape set to orchestral Bach, caught in a 70s basement from which no child returns naive or sheltered. I like the style of its prognosticator, the indie ornery a little protected (behind closed glass) and without the larger ambitions of magazine music. There really isn't a foothold or a ladder; it is plainly forgettable and seminal. No other music appears to us, from the ether, besides its local progeny. And even then that music is stolid, good but usually musically uneventful. This is an 'event film' suffering all the faults of a Lawrence of Arabia artistic vehicle and all of its hard beauty, classic, in other words, so inevitable.",
