  "body": "Maybe this album deserves a 10, I don't know. It certainly created a moment in time for popular music, no small feat, but over time after many listens I've found myself becoming bothered by the implication these guys make that they're the singular perpetrators of a war against modern America in the name of 'intellectualism'. No, Ezra and Rostam, Chris and Chris, you are not the sole arbitrators of a new-wave of youthful intellectualism. That being said, the album of-course bangs. 'Mansard Roof', 'Oxford Comma', 'A-Punk', 'Campus', 'Bryn', 'I Stand Corrected', 'Walcott', and the stunning 'The Kids Don't Stand a Chance' are indie rock at its very best. 'Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa' low-key sucks, I'd prefer 'Arrows' or 'Ladies of Cambridge', and 'M79'. I used to love it, until Columbia rejected me. I'd written about it. Maybe I should've wrote about post-imperialist societal shifts in husbandry customs."
