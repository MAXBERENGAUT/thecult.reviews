  "body": "When you first hear Bladee, he's not even on the spectrum of what you consider music. His trick, evident in every one of his projects, is to create his own unique and complete artistic vision of what exactly that thing called music is. The end result is sad and glitchy, almost gimmicky, but it works, and its flaws are so intertwined with its strengths that I don't think its flaws really matter. Sure, his autotune wails are a far cry from any technical virtuosity, but he has an idea of how he wants to be different, and he can put it into words. The songs on 'Gluee' have a lo-fi underground rap production aesthetic borrowed from America, but the technique and style for how to approach it is entirely different. Songs like 'Deletee', 'Spellbound', and 'Unreal', reform the haziness of American cloud rap into a cavernous orchestra of melodic edited vocal tracks and left-of-center thoughtful production. His lyrics, characteristically earnest, are great rap lyrics. Studied, memorable, and imagery-laden, they fit perfectly into the airy space of the production, which despite its clouds feels positively sunny. His vocals are stilted, slurred, painful, but always drenched in inward emotion and really powerfully felt. Instead of being the death of music, this stylistic approach invents a new type of musical euphoria, forming songs that are less about literal meaning and more about the expression of quickly evaporating feelings, impressionistically painting a drug-filled youthful psyche, sometimes almost transcendental in its scope (\"Someone rather than no one\", \"I got the keys to the city / GTB I see machines in the city / Helicopters when I leave in December\"). It would be less special if it seemed like someone else had done it first."
