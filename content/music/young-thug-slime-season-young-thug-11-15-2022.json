  "body": "With big rap projects you are barking up the wrong tree if you want something perfect. Slime Season has 1 flaw, it's the inferior Slime Season. Despite that issue, which is only really a relative issue, as a rap music fan you will love this project. About 2/3 of these songs are some of the most fun music that's ever been made in the 21st century. It will probably be a slightly different set of songs for each person, they are all beautifully unique because of Thug's intrinsic talent, but my favorites are 'Take Kare, Quarterback, Best Friend, Power, No Way, Mine, Again, That's All, UDiggWhatImSayin, Draw Down, Wood Would, Wanna Be Me'. If that was an album just on its own perhaps Slime Season is discussed more critically speaking, but I don't really think that's the artistic purpose of this product. It's basically a talented rap artist dropping around 20 songs from his favorites, and while doing so blazing an original path into popular music trendsetting. He has so much fun doing things that some famous people never could do. Every song he somehow invents an entirely new and seemingly perfect flow that matches in step simultaneously the short and long term sonic architecture of the beat. While these beats all have similar elements, they paint vividly different pictures, and the scene that Thug plays out in each song feels newly euphoric in the same way watching the next episode of the show you're binging does. There's always that big question, of course, about whether or not you like this music. My freshman year roommate thought most music I played (like this) was too hard for him. You know, fair enough. I can't hate on someone for not liking what I like."
