  "body": "A mixture of slow-core, shoegaze, Elliot Smith, and some dream pop touches, Deadharrie's music is full, compact, and dense through all of his now eight album run that started in 2021. Most of his songs feature layered guitars; a raspy, melodic and soft voice that establishes a similar tempo; lyrics that are not ostentatious; and a subtle, rewarding depth to the songwriting. William Harries, Deadharrie, is from Florida. His music hasn't picked up much traction outside of the internet - algorithm recommender pong game for new and interesting sophisticated indie rock music - spaces where Melania Kol, Double Knee, and Winter reside. My favorite song on this album is 'Think I Just Might'. He is a great artistic inventor, the albums feel warmly collectible even only as MP3s.",
