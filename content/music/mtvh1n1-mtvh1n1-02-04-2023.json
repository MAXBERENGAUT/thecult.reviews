  "body": "I'm not very good at writing music reviews. For one I have no drive or urge to make my own music, besides rambling over beats someone else made. While I may someday put it out there on the internet I likely will not have anything of substance come of it. Secondly, I attack people or ideas sometimes in my writing. But, when I attack someone in my writing, it's done with the assumption that nobody cares. Why would someone care that I like this music infinitely more than Drake? I'm just a guy on the internet. What makes my opinion important? The fact that I made a website to house my opinions? Really? Mtvh1n1 are from Julia's War recordings in Philly and they make a whole album full of the sonic textures Women had back in the day, with an additional concise surf-pop ethos I really enjoy. The lyrics are clarity-inducing, \"Look at yourself you're a mess!\", \"Fuck the fashion week they said\", \"Fingers in the rice... Focus on the Habsburgs\". The hooks come so nicely. I really enjoy music that is both dark and accessible, it's what makes me happy! Oh right! That's why I write! It makes me happy. 'The Gardener', 'Theses', 'Mulling About', 'Order', 'Fashion Week', 'Shrinking Window', 'Habsburgs', 'Goggles', 'Grip', 'Blood'.",
