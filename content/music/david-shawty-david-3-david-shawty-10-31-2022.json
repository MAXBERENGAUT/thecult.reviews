  "body": "David Shawty is a white rapper from Seattle who makes glitchy hyper-pop/cloud-rap in a repetitive manner, like many other online rappers. He's a little different though, because his track record of projects shows a deep artistic sensibility that stands out from the pack, with innovative interpretations of themes and ideas many other artists have. It feels unique, I mean. And new. David 3 is the third in a collection of projects David's released this past year or two, with the excellent short project 'Whatever, by David' (2021) and the exciting 'Psycho Nitemare' (2022), and it's the best of them. Most of these songs work with what they have, and are well curated to feel separate and distinct, while still being spiritually connected. The lyrics here especially sort of shocked me, because while there's nothing revelatory he has an interesting ability to avoid too much repetition, unlike some of his peers, and I don't know if I ever heard a word more than once (besides the themed ones). On the best beats here, they do more than enough to let out goeey innards of the modern pop production. At their best, the lyrics can be psychologically insightful and ridiculous, interesting without having to make any personal confessions. It's also an extremely consistent album, all the sonic textures sound organized coherently towards the same general artistic ideal, catchy and edgy esotericism, so the production (done by David, Keyblade, & others) is phenomenal. Out of 18 songs there are maybe 2 or 3 which don't work. That's crazy. I really like how much he doesn't care about anyone's opinions on his art. People don't know what they're looking at even if it looks them in the eyes."
