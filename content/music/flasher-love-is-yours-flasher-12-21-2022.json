  "body": "Out of the ashes of Yo La Tengo comes D.C. indie rock band Flasher who are a bright spot of pop in a local scene bereft with classic rock enthusiasts. Songs like 'I Saw You', 'Little Things', 'Nothing', 'Spell it Out', 'Still Life', 'All Day Long', 'Sideways', 'Damage', 'Dial Up', and 'Tangerine' are great little icons of unique pop music. The guitar textures are picture-perfect. I'm curious where they can take this sound further, but with a 2022 project like this already under their name, they could prolly stand to tour for a long while before dropping anything more. It's fun to listen to.",
