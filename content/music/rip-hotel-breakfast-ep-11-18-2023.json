  "body": "I'm not writing about anything ever again. This is the last of this place. I've always felt I had a readership of 0 but tonight I feel whatever number it is my actions have only made my life worse. It's hard to sort out feelings when you avoid everyone. Sorry. Anyway this EP is actually really cool the first song and the third and fourth song are great. Super fun. Sad but super fun. The second song sucks, at least in the beginning, it gives off the wrong vibe. Sometimes your parents are the only ones who say you aren't a pariah. My parents just happen to be old as fuck and one of them needed Israel to survive when he got kicked out of the Soviet Union for being jewish. They are super rich though compared to most people on this earth. Much safer. Bye bye."
