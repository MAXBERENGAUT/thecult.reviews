  "body": "Covers are a great way to know if an album's good or not. You just have to know what you're looking for. 'Start Together', 'Hot Rock', 'The End of You', 'Burn, Don't Freeze', 'god is a Number', 'Banned from the End of the World', 'Don't Talk Like', 'Get Up', 'One Song For You', 'The Size of Our Love', 'Living in Exile', 'Memorize Your Lines', 'A Quarter to Three'. These songs are dense, lovely, and exciting. The dual-singer three-piece lineup seems strangely human, at a glance, but in sonic form it becomes superhuman. This is the music that makes you believe in our future as a human race. I love (really like I mean) queer people."
