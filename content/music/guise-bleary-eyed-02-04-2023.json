  "body": "Bleary Eyed are another band from the beautifully websitted Philly label Julia's War which puts out a lot of nice modern shoegaze music. Bleary Eyed are one of my favorites, because their songs are endlessly interesting, they exist as swarms of bouncing contradictions, lyrically and structurally complex, and in general I just like their texture. Their best hooks are some of the best hooks I've heard in a while. On 'Spark' and 'Holy Hell' they recreate some of my favorite music listening moments in the form of original pop music. Never before have I felt the word 'matches' and the word 'inside' have so much internal weight and worth to them. They've recreated catchiness. Sorry for all the ad hominems in these compliments, but I just like listening to this music. This was one of those albums for me where it took so long to get to the end because of how much I liked the songs at the beginning. 'Sequence', 'Spark', 'This Loss', 'Common Thought', 'Springblue', 'Holy Hell', 'Lighthouse', 'Take the Car', 'Jenny', 'Caterpillar', 'The Well'.",
