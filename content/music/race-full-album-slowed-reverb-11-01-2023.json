  "body": "In the beginning there was little I could do about it. It was outside my control. Later on I could, but I was also so scared, and it was always at a time I wasn't expecting. I am not really that good at anything. I don't make mistakes anymore but I don't have her in my bed, all the same. She makes me so angry. I've just sat for an interview. I was nervous and rubbing my thighs. Now I think I've been duped. The only thing I can do is pretend she means nothing to me. After all that's what a normal person would feel. I see how she reacts to me and I understand how it's never going to happen. I don't even like her. She isn't perfect. I like perfect. She might like being my perfect but that doesn't mean she cares. I'm better than that. Next time I see her I'll look at her and tell her with my eyes what she doesn't have. There's leagues and leagues beneath the sea between what she has and what everyone else has. She'll be lost forever.",
